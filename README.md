# OpenCVMiniProj

## 1.DivideSurface.py
  Dividing the suraface given the list of hole's vertex and object's vertex to the piece of triangle primitives for creating this surface in openGL.
  
  Furthermore, there are additing function which can create the normal basic object by generating the back side and the edge between them.
  
  --only avaliable for 0-1 hole--
  
  
## 2.FilterContour.py
  Try to removing as most as possible contours generated by cv2.findCountours while retaining the shape given the binary image.
  
  
## 3.VirtualPaint.py
  Virtual painting program can track the specific color for drawing the line.
  
  User can also change the pen color and size.
  
  
## 4.DistancingDetect.py
  Detect human in picture and roughly determine whether they too close to each other or not.
  
  
## 5.ImprovingEyeDetect.py
  Improving Eye Detection of cv2.CascadeClassifier. In Any detected face, they are either 2 eyes or none.
